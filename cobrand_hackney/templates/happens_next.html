<p>
We now have a record on our system which will be assigned to an Officer. They
will investigate this issue.
</p>

<p>
If this issue is persistent or recurring, please read our
<a href="https://hackney.gov.uk/noise">noise page</a>, which details what you
can do and how we might be able to help you.
</p>

<p>
We also recommend you record new instances against this report using this site.
This will act as evidence if the case goes to court. If you don't add new
reports within 3 weeks, we will assume that the nuisance has ceased and your
case will be closed and no further action will be taken.
</p>

<p>
Should the noise occur between 6.30pm and 02:00am on a Thursday, 9.00pm and
02.00am on a Friday / Saturday, or 6.30pm and 02.00am on Sunday, please contact
the out of hours team on <a href="tel:020 8356 4455">020 8356 4455</a>. If the
noise is ongoing, we will visit you to try and witness the nuisance (other
priorities permitting) and if necessary, take action to stop it.
</p>

<p>
If the noise occurs at any other time please use this site and check the "I
have reported this before" option at the start of the process. Out of hours
monitoring visits can be arranged if additional reports show that the noise is
regularly occurring outside our office hours. If, at any time we witness noise
that amounts to a statutory nuisance, then a noise abatement notice would
normally be served on the person responsible. If the noise continues after
that, a prosecution would be considered, if we can prove that the notice has
been breached. <b>Please note</b>: without witnessing the nuisance, there is
only limited action we can take.
</p>

<p>
